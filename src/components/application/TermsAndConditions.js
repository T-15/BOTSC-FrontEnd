                <p>The Burlington Old Timers Soccer Club includes both an Over 45 Division and an Over 60 Division that play on Sunday Mornings. If you are over 60 you can still play in the Over 45 Division. We also have a Masters Group (55 and over) who play pickup soccer on Thursday Mornings between 10AM and 12 Noon. You can play both Sundays and Thursdays.</p>
